The root account is the most privileged account with all the access, hence protecting it is a necessity.

### Use CloudShell
AWS CloudShell is a browser-based shell, you can quickly run scripts with the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), experiment with service APIs using the AWS CLI, and use other tools to increase your productivity. The CloudShell icon appears in AWS Regions where CloudShell is available.

The AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) includes a bash-compatible command-completion feature that enables you to use the Tab key to complete a partially entered command, thus improving your productivity.

To configure auto-prompt I used this command in the CloudShell:
```
aws --cli-auto-prompt
```
